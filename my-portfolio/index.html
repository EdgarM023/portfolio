      <article>
        <p>After graduating from high school, I moved to the United States. I became a mailman, and I loved working with people around me. I quit my job to be able to realize my dream and work as a software engineer.</p>
        <p>As a <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> student, I started my career by becoming a software engineer.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for a software engineer to hire or looking for a partner to work together, please reach out. I'm too excited to be able to work with other software engineers and share knowledge.</p>
